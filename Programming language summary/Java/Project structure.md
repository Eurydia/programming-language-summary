# Project structure

A class has its own directory.

```plaintext
(root)/
	- projectname/
		- src/
			- classa/
```

In each class directory, a collection of related classes is stored along side the primary source file.

```plaintext
(root)/
	- projectname/
		- src/
			- classa/
				- ClassA.java
				- ClassAMain.java
				- ClassATest.java
```
